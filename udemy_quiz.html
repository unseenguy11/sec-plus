While skilled, independent black hat hackers operate on their own and may not have the substantial resources a larger organization might. Though they have deep knowledge in cybersecurity, security researchers typically operate independently or within institutions, focusing on studying and mitigating threats. The main intent of an open-source development community is on collaborative software development and not cyber-attacks." }, { "id": 2, "promptHtml": "If a company's server has an estimated Single Loss Expectancy (SLE) of $15,000 due to an operational failure, and the Annual Rate of Occurrence (ARO) of these failures is expected to be 0.1 times per year, what is the Annual Loss Expectancy (ALE)?", "answers": ["$15,000", "$150", "$150,000", "$1,500"], "correct": [3], "multi": false, "explanation": "OBJ: 5.2 - The ALE is calculated by multiplying the SLE by the ARO. With an SLE of $15,000 and an ARO of 0.1, the ALE equals $1,500 ($15,000 * 0.1 = $1,500). This represents the expected yearly financial loss due to operational failures. $150 isn't correct. $15,000 isn't correct.  $150,000 isn't correct." }, { "id": 3, "promptHtml": "As part of a new building initiative, Dion Training Solutions plans to connect two office buildings via a direct physical link. Which measure will BEST protect the physical infrastructure connectivity?", "answers": ["Installing the cable in a conduit buried underground.", "Placing the cable on the ground between buildings.", "Running the connection on overhead poles.", "Using wireless bridges without encryption."], "correct": [0], "multi": false, "explanation": "OBJ: 3.2 - Burying the connection underground within a protective conduit offers protection from environmental factors and unauthorized tampering. Laying cables on the ground without protection can expose them to damage and unauthorized access. Unencrypted wireless bridges can be susceptible to eavesdropping and interception. Overhead poles expose the connection to environmental factors and potential tampering, making it less secure." }, { "id": 4, "promptHtml": "What is the primary difference between sanitization and destruction in the disposal process?", "answers": ["Sanitization and destruction are synonyms and refer to the same process.", "Sanitization involves erasing data so it cannot be recovered; destruction is total physical demolition of the asset.", "Sanitization refers to physically damaging the asset to render it unusable, while destruction involves completely eliminating all residual data.", "Sanitization concerns the reuse of assets in an organization, and destruction involves transferring those assets to a different department."], "correct": [1], "multi": false, "explanation": "OBJ: 4.6 - Sanitization involves the process of permanently erasing or de-identifying data on a device so it cannot be recovered, while destruction is about physically demolishing the asset, ensuring no data can be extracted from it. Sanitization does not refer to physically damaging the asset; instead, it has to do with removing or de-identifying data so it cannot be recovered. Destruction involves physical destruction of the asset itself. Sanitization and destruction refer to two different types of procedures in the disposal process and are not synonyms. Sanitization and destruction involve methods of removing or totally destroying data or assets rather than internal asset redistribution in an organization." }, { "id": 5, "promptHtml": "Enrique, the head of IT at Dion Training, is tasked with ensuring all deployed company systems adhere to a set of standardized configurations. He wants to reduce the attack surface as much as possible. Which of the following techniques would BEST reduce the organization's attack surface?", "answers": ["Deploying antivirus software on all company workstations and other devices.", "Requiring frequent password resets for all employees.", "Implementing a VPN for any remote access to company devices.", "Turning off all unused services and closing unnecessary ports."], "correct": [3], "multi": false, "explanation": "OBJ: 4.1 - Deactivating unused services and closing ports minimizes potential entry points for attackers, thus effectively reducing the attack surface by limiting exposed system components. VPNs secure remote connections by encrypting data in transit. However, while they enhance the security of data communication, they don't necessarily reduce the attack surface of the underlying systems. While antivirus software provides protection against malware and certain threats, it doesn't directly reduce the attack surface. It's an essential layer of defense but doesn't minimize system exposure by itself. Regularly changing passwords enhances security against potential unauthorized access but doesn't directly affect the attack surface related to system configurations or open services." }, { "id": 6, "promptHtml": "Dion Training Solutions is aiming to optimize their wide-area network (WAN) while ensuring advanced network management and performance optimization. They are considering a solution that can be deployed both on-premises and in the cloud. Which of the following technologies would BEST match their requirements?", "answers": ["TLS", "SD-WAN", "AH", "SASE"], "correct": [1], "multi": false, "explanation": "OBJ: 3.2 - SD-WAN (Software-defined wide area network) provides centralized network management, flexible routing, and traffic management capabilities. It can be hosted both on-premises and in the cloud, giving it an edge for comprehensive WAN optimization.  TLS (Transport Layer Security) operates at the application layer and is primarily used for securing application-level communication. It doesn't offer WAN optimization or centralized network management. While SASE offers both network security and WAN capabilities, its primary selling point is as a cloud-based solution that integrates both. It doesn't focus solely on WAN performance optimization. AH (Authentication header) is a protocol component of IPSec which offers packet integrity but does not specifically cater to WAN optimization or management." }, { "id": 7, "promptHtml": "Given the need for resilience and the ability to recover in a security architecture, which of the following devices ensures uninterrupted operation during a power outage?", "answers": ["Voltage Regulator", "Onsite/offsite backups", "Power Strip", "Uninterruptible power supply (UPS)"], "correct": [3], "multi": false, "explanation": "OBJ: 3.4 - A UPS is a device that provides emergency power to a load when the input power source fails, thus ensuring continuous operation. A voltage regulator ensures that the voltage supplied to a device remains constant, even if there are fluctuations in the power source. However, it does not provide backup power during an outage. While onsite and offsite backups ensure data preservation, they don't guarantee power supply during a power loss. While a power strip allows for multiple devices to be plugged in simultaneously, it does not provide any form of power backup or protection against outages." }, { "id": 8, "promptHtml": "A software development company regularly releases software updates to its global customer base. Recently, some customers reported receiving unauthorized and potentially malicious software updates. The company wants to implement a security technique to ensure the authenticity and integrity of its software updates when delivered to customers. Which of the following would BEST assist in achieving this goal?", "answers": ["Code Signing", "Multi-factor Authentication", "Intrusion Detection System", "Antivirus Scanning"], "correct": [0], "multi": false, "explanation": "OBJ: 4.1 - Code signing is a security technique that allows software developers to digitally sign their software updates before distribution. By using cryptographic signatures, code signing ensures the authenticity and integrity of the software updates. When customers receive the updates, their systems can verify the signature to confirm that the update came from a trusted source and that it has not been altered during transmission. This is an effective way for the company to guarantee the legitimacy of its software updates and protect customers from potentially malicious or unauthorized modifications. An Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is a security solution that monitors network traffic and system activities to detect suspicious or malicious behavior. While IDS is valuable for identifying potential security incidents, it primarily focuses on network-level security and does not directly address the authenticity and integrity of software updates and it is not the most appropriate technique for ensuring the legitimacy of software updates. Multi-factor authentication (MFA) is a security method that requires users to provide two or more forms of identification before accessing a system. MFA is commonly used to enhance user authentication and access control. However, it is not directly related to verifying the authenticity and integrity of software updates when delivered to customers. MFA does not address the process of ensuring that the software updates are coming from a trusted source and have not been tampered with during distribution. Therefore, while MFA is a valuable security measure, it is not the most suitable technique for the company's current objective. Antivirus scanning is a security measure that involves using antivirus software to detect and remove malware from a system. While antivirus scanning is crucial for protecting computers from known malware, it does not directly address the authenticity and integrity of software updates. It focuses on identifying and removing existing malware but does not ensure that the software updates are legitimate and have not been tampered with during distribution." }, { "id": 9, "promptHtml": "Which of the following characteristics of a cloud architecture model describes a model that can quickly recover from failures due to adverse conditions?", "answers": ["Ease of Deployment", "Scalability", "Resilience", "Availability"], "correct": [2], "multi": false, "explanation": "OBJ: 3.1 - Resilience in cloud architecture refers to the ability of the system to quickly recover from failures and maintain operational performance, crucial for ensuring availability during adverse conditions. Availability refers to guaranteeing a system will continue to operate so that the system can be used regardless of conditions. Resilience, like availability, refers to keeping a system functioning, but also directly addresses how quickly a system can recover after adverse conditions have led to a failure. Scalability means that the system can expand when more resources are needed without creating lags or problems for users. This expansion isn't considered an adverse condition. Increased business is seen as a positive attribute. Resilience is the ability of a system to quickly recover after failures due to adverse conditions. Ease of Deployment means that new instances and the entire cloud environment can be easily created. Resilience is the ability to maintain operational performance and recover quickly from failures.\nFor support or reporting issues, include Question ID: 651707dd7ae092b7640ec669 in your ticket. Thank you." }, { "id": 10, "promptHtml": "Which of the following is an aspect of asset management that ensures that each IT asset is clearly associated with a specific individual or department, providing clarity on responsibilities and access rights?", "answers": ["Ownership", "Monitoring", "Acquisition", "Decommissioning"], "correct": [0], "multi": false, "explanation": "OBJ: 4.2 - Ownership helps in determining who is responsible for the asset, ensuring clear lines of accountability and often helping in deciding the access rights. Monitoring involves keeping an eye on the performance and status of assets, rather than establishing responsibility. Decommissioning pertains to the process of retiring assets and doesn't directly associate assets with specific entities. Acquisition refers to the process of obtaining assets, not the association of assets with individuals or departments." }, { "id": 11, "promptHtml": "Susan, a security analyst at Kelly Innovations LLC, is reviewing alerts from the IPS. She recognizes a pattern of false positives from signature-based detections. Which of the following is the MOST likely cause for false positives in signature-based detection systems?", "answers": ["Signature databases are stored in volatile memory.", "The system is only updated with old signatures.", "The signatures require tuning.", "The IPS is scanning encrypted traffic only."], "correct": [2], "multi": false, "explanation": "OBJ: 4.5 - When signatures are overly broad or not precisely defined, they might incorrectly match legitimate network traffic, leading to false positives. Signature-based detection works by inspecting traffic patterns, whether encrypted or not. However, the encrypted nature of traffic isn't the primary reason for false positives in signature-based detection. While outdated signatures might miss newer threats, they aren't typically the cause of false positives. Instead, they might lead to false negatives. Where the signature database is stored does not influence the accuracy of the detection. It's the quality and precision of the signatures that matter most." }, { "id": 12, "promptHtml": "Which of the following ports, if left open and unmonitored, might allow database queries from unauthorized external sources?", "answers": ["Port 443", "Port 53", "Port 21", "Port 1433"], "correct": [3], "multi": false, "explanation": "OBJ: 2.5 - Port 1433  is the default for Microsoft SQL Server. Organizations typically restrict or monitor access to this port to prevent unauthorized database operations. Domain Name System (DNS) uses port 53 for resolving domain names into IP addresses. It isn't associated with database operations. Port 443 is used for secure web traffic through SSL/TLS. It's not directly related to database queries. File Transfer Protocol (FTP) uses port 21 for unencrypted data transfers, not for database operations." }, { "id": 13, "promptHtml": "Which of the following BEST describes a threat actor who primarily depends on commonly found tools, often easily accessible from the web or dark web?", "answers": ["Bug bounty hunter", "Ethical hacker", "APT", "Script kiddie"], "correct": [3], "multi": false, "explanation": "OBJ: 2.1 - Typically a novice in cyber-attacks, a script kiddie heavily relies on off-the-shelf tools without much understanding of how they work. A Bug bounty hunter is an individual who seeks software vulnerabilities in exchange for rewards or compensation but doesn't rely solely on basic, common tools. Advanced persistent threats (APTs) are often state-sponsored groups with significant resources, known for long-term, targeted attacks using a variety of sophisticated tools and techniques.

Providing unrestricted access to user account data without authentication or authorization is highly insecure and violates the principles of access management. OAuth's purpose is to provide controlled access to specific data, ensuring that third-party applications are authorized only for the data they require and nothing more. While generating random access tokens is a step in the right direction, sharing them directly with third-party applications is not recommended. OAuth operates on the principle of \"authorization delegation,\" where the user grants access to specific data to third-party applications. Access tokens should be issued by an authorization server and presented by the third-party application to access limited data on behalf of the user.
